Linked list is a data structure that stores elements in nodes, where each node contains:
- data,
- reference to the next AND previous node (in java, because java.util.LinkedList i  doubly linked)


--- Implementation ---

- LinkedList<E> is part of java.util
- it implements:
    - List<E>: behaves like a list,
    - Deque<E>: can be used as Queue or Deque
    - Cloneable and Serializable

Each node contains:

private static class Node<E> {
    E item;         // value
    Node<E> next;   // reference to next node
    Node<E> prev;   // reference to previous node
}

LinkedList also keeps reference to the first and last element of the list

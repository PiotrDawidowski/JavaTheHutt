with getters, You can get altered data from an object, you can add characters or strings to Ints or doubles ($1000, int -> String)
you can return parent type of a type you have (ArrayList<> can be changed to List<> and still return the data.

With setters you can do widening (accept "bigger" type than defined in class):

private int price;

public void setPrice(double price) {
    this.price = (int) price;  // explicit narrowing conversion
}
